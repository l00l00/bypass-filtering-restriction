Understood! If you’re unable to use **ProxyDroid** and **ConnectBot** due to root access limitations on your Android device, there are still several alternatives you can explore for routing traffic through an SSH tunnel. Here are some options that do not require root access:

### Alternative Options to Use SSH on Android Without Root

1. **SSH Tunneling Apps (No Root)**

   Several SSH tunneling apps are designed to create an SSH connection and route traffic without requiring root access. Here are a couple of good options:

   **A. Termux + ProxyDroid (Without Root)**

   While ProxyDroid typically requires root, you can still use Termux to create an SSH tunnel and route apps through it without needing to manipulate `iptables`. You can achieve this by using the built-in `ssh` command to create a SOCKS proxy and configuring individual apps to use that proxy.

   **Steps**:
   - Launch Termux and run:
     ```bash
     ssh -D 8080 -f -C -q -N user@your-server-ip
     ```
   - Here, `-f` sends the SSH process to the background, `-C` enables compression, and `-N` tells SSH not to execute a remote command (just keep the tunnel open).
   - Now you can configure supported apps to use the SOCKS proxy:
     - For browsers like **Firefox**, you can configure them to use a SOCKS proxy through settings.
     - For apps that allow proxy configuration (like some messaging apps), set them to `localhost` with port `8080`.

   **B. Shadowsocks**

   Shadowsocks is an open-source proxy solution that works similarly to a SOCKS proxy but is optimized for speed and security.

   **Steps**:
   - **Server Setup**: Install Shadowsocks on your remote server. You can follow the installation instructions on the [Shadowsocks GitHub](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev).
   - **Android Client**: Download the Shadowsocks client from [GitHub](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android/releases).
   - **Configuration**: Open the Shadowsocks app and configure it with your server's details (IP address, port, and password).
   - Once connected, the app will create a local proxy for your Android device, allowing you to route traffic through it without root access.

2. **VPN Solutions**

If you want a more robust and user-friendly approach, you could set up a VPN. This way, you won’t have to deal with `iptables` or any proxy settings:

   **A. OpenVPN**

   - **Server Setup**: You can set up an OpenVPN server on your remote machine. Follow the installation instructions provided in the OpenVPN documentation.
   - **Android Client**: Install the OpenVPN client from the Google Play Store.
   - **Configuration**: Import the client configuration file generated on the OpenVPN server and connect.
   - The OpenVPN app will create a secure tunnel to your server, routing all internet traffic through it without needing root access.

   **B. WireGuard**

   - **Server Setup**: Similar to OpenVPN, set up a WireGuard server on your remote machine.
   - **Android Client**: Install the WireGuard app from the Google Play Store.
   - **Configuration**: Configure the WireGuard client with the server details and connect.
   - WireGuard provides a lightweight and efficient alternative for secure tunneling.

3. **SSH Tunneling via Apps**

There are also apps specifically designed to set up SSH tunnels without requiring root access, though they might have limitations regarding app support:

   **A. SSH Tunnel (Paid App)**

   - You can try an app like **SSH Tunnel**, which is a paid solution allowing you to create SSH tunnels without rooting your device. This app provides a straightforward interface to set up an SSH connection and route your traffic through it.

   **B. VPN Gate**

   - **VPN Gate** is a free VPN service that provides access to multiple public VPN servers. It can help you connect without needing root access, and it's based on the SoftEther VPN protocol, which can also leverage SSH tunneling.

### Summary of Options

- **Use Termux to create a SOCKS proxy** and configure individual apps (like Firefox) to use it.
- **Set up Shadowsocks** on your server and use the Android client for a simple proxy solution.
- **Deploy OpenVPN or WireGuard** for a full VPN setup that works without root access.
- Explore dedicated SSH tunneling apps or VPN services like VPN Gate that provide proxy capabilities.

These methods should help you establish a secure and efficient connection from your Android device without requiring root access or manipulating `iptables`. If you need detailed instructions on any specific option, feel free to ask!
