Got it! Since you're committed to using open-source tools, let’s dive deeper into how **ProxyDroid** and **ConnectBot** work under the hood and examine the technical details behind them. I'll break down their functionalities and the core concepts involved.

### 1. **ProxyDroid**: An Overview

**GitHub Repo**: [ProxyDroid](https://github.com/madeye/proxydroid)

ProxyDroid is an Android application designed to route traffic from apps through different types of proxies (SOCKS, HTTP, etc.). It’s especially useful for integrating with tools like `ssh -D`, which creates a SOCKS proxy.

#### How ProxyDroid Works:

- **Proxy Configuration**: It allows users to configure a proxy (e.g., SOCKS or HTTP) and apply it system-wide or on a per-app basis. The proxy can be set up to route traffic through localhost (like your SSH -D setup) or a remote server.
  
- **Routing Traffic**: 
   - It uses **iptables** (a Linux kernel-level packet filtering system) to redirect app traffic to the proxy. Since Android runs on a Linux-based kernel, it can manipulate network traffic using iptables.
   - ProxyDroid captures all outbound network requests and reroutes them through the specified proxy.

- **Translating Requests**: When an Android app makes a network request, ProxyDroid intercepts the traffic, translates it into the proxy protocol (e.g., SOCKS5 or HTTP), and sends it through the proxy to the internet. This way, apps that don’t have native proxy support can still work with a proxy.

##### Key Components:
- **Proxy Settings Interface**: Users configure proxy parameters (e.g., proxy type, host, port, username, password). These are stored and applied via `iptables` rules.
- **Iptables Management**: ProxyDroid issues commands to iptables, which routes app traffic to the localhost port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080) where the SOCKS proxy from `ssh -D` is running.
- **Multiple Proxy Types**: It supports various types of proxies: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5, allowing flexibility depending on the use case.
- **Root Access**: On rooted devices, ProxyDroid can modify system-level networking components to manage traffic more effectively (e.g., system-wide proxying). On non-rooted devices, it is restricted to app-specific routing.

##### Example of Iptables for Routing:
When ProxyDroid configures iptables, it might issue commands like this to route traffic:
```bash
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner <app_uid> -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:<proxy_port>
```
This command sends the traffic from the specified app (denoted by `uid-owner`) to the proxy running on `127.0.0.1:<proxy_port>`.

### 2. **ConnectBot**: An Overview

**GitHub Repo**: [ConnectBot](https://github.com/connectbot/connectbot)

ConnectBot is an open-source SSH client for Android. It allows you to create SSH connections, manage port forwarding, and perform SSH-based tunneling, including setting up SOCKS proxies via dynamic port forwarding (`ssh -D`).

#### How ConnectBot Works:

- **SSH Client**: At its core, ConnectBot implements the SSH protocol, which establishes secure, encrypted communication between the client (your Android device) and a remote server. It uses **public-key cryptography** to authenticate users and **symmetric encryption** (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) for secure data transmission.
  
- **Port Forwarding**:
  - **Local Forwarding**: Forwards local ports to remote servers (useful for accessing a local service from a remote machine).
  - **Remote Forwarding**: Allows remote servers to access local ports.
  - **Dynamic Forwarding (SOCKS Proxy)**: This is what you're leveraging with `ssh -D`. When you initiate `ssh -D`, ConnectBot opens a SOCKS proxy on your Android device and routes all outbound traffic through the SSH tunnel to the remote server.

#### How Dynamic Port Forwarding Works (`ssh -D`):

1. **SOCKS Proxy Setup**:
   - The `ssh -D` option in ConnectBot (and in any SSH client) creates a **SOCKS proxy** locally, typically at `localhost:8080`.
   - SOCKS proxies are versatile, protocol-agnostic proxies that work at a lower level than HTTP proxies. They can forward any kind of traffic (TCP and optionally UDP), making them useful for tunneling all types of data.
   
2. **Traffic Interception and Encryption**:
   - When you connect via `ssh -D`, any traffic sent to the SOCKS proxy is forwarded through the SSH tunnel to the remote server. ConnectBot captures outbound connections, packages them into encrypted SSH packets, and forwards them to the SSH server.
   - On the remote server, the SSH daemon unwraps these packets and sends them to their final destination on the internet.
   
3. **SOCKS Proxy Routing**:
   - When you configure your Android apps (or ProxyDroid) to send traffic through `127.0.0.1:8080`, it routes that traffic through the SSH tunnel established by ConnectBot.

#### Key Components:
- **SSH Protocol Support**: ConnectBot implements the SSH2 protocol, which involves secure key exchange (using RSA or ED25519), encryption (AES, ChaCha20), and authentication (password or public/private keys).
- **Port Forwarding Interface**: Users can configure local, remote, or dynamic port forwarding within the app. In your case, dynamic forwarding (SOCKS proxy via `ssh -D`) is of interest.
- **Connection Manager**: ConnectBot manages multiple simultaneous SSH connections, letting you switch between different servers or SSH tunnels easily.

### How They Work Together

1. **ConnectBot** sets up the **SOCKS proxy** using `ssh -D`, allowing you to tunnel traffic from Android through a remote server via SSH.

2. **ProxyDroid** intercepts Android app traffic using **iptables** and routes the traffic through the local SOCKS proxy set up by ConnectBot.

3. Together, these tools allow seamless traffic routing from any Android app through an SSH tunnel to your server.

### Under the Hood: Connection Flow

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the technical flow:

1. **SSH Connection**: You launch ConnectBot and connect to your remote server, initiating an SSH session and creating a local SOCKS proxy via `ssh -D`.
   
2. **SOCKS Proxy**: ConnectBot opens the SOCKS proxy on `127.0.0.1:8080` (or another specified port). Any traffic sent to this port will be encrypted and forwarded to the remote server.

3. **ProxyDroid Setup**: 
   - ProxyDroid configures iptables to reroute app-specific or system-wide traffic through `127.0.0.1:8080`.
   - It captures outbound traffic from Android apps and sends it to the SOCKS proxy.

4. **Traffic Encryption**: The traffic is now forwarded through the SSH tunnel by ConnectBot, encrypted, and sent to the remote server.

5. **Server Unwrapping**: On the remote server, the SSH daemon decrypts the traffic and forwards it to its intended destination (e.g., a website, API, etc.).

6. **Response Handling**: The response follows the same route back through the SSH tunnel, arriving at your Android device, where ProxyDroid routes it back to the original app.

### Summary of How They Work

- **ConnectBot**: Establishes an SSH connection and creates a SOCKS proxy for dynamic port forwarding (`ssh -D`). It encrypts and routes all outbound traffic from the SOCKS proxy to the SSH server.
- **ProxyDroid**: Uses `iptables` to redirect Android app traffic to the SOCKS proxy created by ConnectBot, ensuring all traffic is tunneled through the secure SSH connection.

By using these two tools, you can leverage SSH-based SOCKS proxies on Android devices using completely open-source software.
